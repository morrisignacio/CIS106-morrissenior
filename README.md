# CIS106-morrissenior

## Assignment 1

I am taking this course because I am interested in learning code and becoming more self-aware with coding tools that will facilitate my journey as an engineer. I have already taken some classes in high school that cover the same material as this class. However, I pretty much forgot most of it, so I am trying to not only retrieve my knowledge but also learned something new.

## Assignment 2

I selected Python for my programming language. I searched in the book and the IDE that interested me the most is Python Tutor, however upon reviewing my options I am going to be selecting repl.it because it's easier for me to learn. I created a Flowgarithm that said Hello world, and I changed the code to Python and Auto Pseudocode. After this I had to make a change on the output and instead of world it displayed Hello "name" and by defining the string "name" as Morris I was able to display Hello Morris. I also did an explanation point at the end so that it could be different. I did this by having an output of "Hello" & name & "!". Finally, I changed the code by going in 'tools' and clicking the 'source code viewer' button to translate it to Python and Auto Pseudocode respectively.
