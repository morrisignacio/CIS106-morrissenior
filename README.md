## Assignment 1

I am taking this course because I am interested in learning code and becoming more self-aware with coding tools that will facilitate my journey as an engineer. I have already taken some classes in high school that cover the same material as this class. However, I pretty much forgot most of it, so I am trying to not only retrieve my knowledge but also learned something new.

## Assignment 2

I selected python for my programming language, I searched in the book and the IDE that interested me the most is PythonTutor and that is that I want to learn. If I can't learn it then I will change it. I created a flowgarithm that said hello world, and I changed the code to python and auto pseudocode.
