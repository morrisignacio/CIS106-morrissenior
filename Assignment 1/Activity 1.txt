start with two pieces of bread
identify each piece of bread 
while the first piece of bread does not have two slices of cheese 
  add two slices of cheese to the first piece of bread 
while the second piece of bread does not have two pieces of lettuce 
  add two pieces of lettuce to the first piece of bread 
if the first piece of bread has two slices of cheese and the second piece of bread has two pieces of lettuce 
  then place the first piece of bread with the side that has two slices of cheese facing the side of the second piece of bread that has the two pieces of lettuce 
  else go back to step 1
